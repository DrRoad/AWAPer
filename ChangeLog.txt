Change log for AWAPer
----------------------

13-Sept-2018
* Bug Issue #2 fixed (point extractions using only the first input coordinate). L263 of extractCatchmentData() edits.

4-April-2019
* netCDF syncing added every 365 days to makeNetCDF_file(). This was done to reduce the loss of data if the code crashed.
* tryCatch() added to linux downloading of AWAP files.

15-April-2019
* For Windows users, a trycatch() was added for 7zip not being installed. If an error is thrown, user advice is output.
* Bug fixed in the calculation of potential evapotranspiration which caused termination. The maximum acceptable data gaps
  was changed from c(20,20,20) to c(99,99,99) and the user was given the option to control which types of data gaps are interpolated.

3-June-2019
* Run-time for the extaction of ET data (using extractCatchmentData()) was significantly reduced by using Evapotranspiration package v1.14 or later. extractCatchmentData() was edited to suppress unnecessary messaging and post-processing by Evapotranspiration.
* Major bug was fixed that caused the solar radiation grids to be flipped vertically.

4-November-2019
* Documentation and code edited to pass "R CMD check --as-cran"  without errors or warnings.
* User prompt added if updating netCDFs when the start date is 1/1/1900.

26-July-2020
* Userdefined time steps added
* Spatial can data returned at a user defined time step
* Bugs fixed in calling xts::index.

6-Aug-2020
* Input for interpolation method rearranged in the calling of raster::extract()
* Input 'interpMethod' added to extractCatchmentData(). This addresses isse request #17 https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/AWAPer/issues/17
