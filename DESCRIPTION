Description: NetCDF files of the Bureau of Meteorology Australian Water Availability Project daily national climate grids are built and used for the efficient extraction of point and catchment area weighted precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, vapour pressure, solar radiation and various measures of evapotranspiration. For details on the source climate data see <http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/>.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.3)
Imports: Evapotranspiration (>= 1.14), ncdf4, R.utils, raster, chron, maptools, sp, zoo, methods, xts
