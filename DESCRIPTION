Description: NetCDF files of the Bureau of Meteorology Australian Water Availability Project daily national climate grids are built for the efficient extraction of daily points and catchment area weighted precipitation, Tmin, Tmax, vapour pressure, solar radiation and then estimation of areal potential evapotranspiration. For details on the source climate data see <http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/>.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.3)
Imports: Evapotranspiration (>= 1.14), ncdf4, R.utils, raster, chron, maptools, sp, zoo, methods
